This is a copy of the google homepage (without functionality) for the odin project assignment 'build the google.com homepage'. 

The page includes elementary html and css cropping and positioning, as well as recreating aspects of an existing page using 'inspect element'. The doodle for that day included a marimba graphic on top of the rest of the doodle, recreated by css cropping the image and raising the z-index.`
